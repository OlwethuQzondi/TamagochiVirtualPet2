<h1>TAMAGOCHI VIRTUAL PET APPLICATION</h1>

<h2>APPLICATION DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The name of the application was taken from the famous "Tamagochi Pet" game from back in the 90s. This application is a "cloned" mini version of the Tamagochi game which has the same values but much more virtual and a bit advanced if you would.</p>

<p>The Tamagochi Virtual Pet gmae is created to allow users to have a fun experience taking careof a virtual pet dog, as it let's users interact with the virtual pet by allowing them to play, feeding it and cleaning it which increases the pet's happiness while at the same time providiing and building a much fun bond between the user and the virtual pet. The motivation behind building this project was simply the fact that the old version of the Tamagochi game which was fully analog, isn't much produced anymore given the fact that the world has gone fully didgital, a more virtual and technologically  advanced version of this game had to be created and provide solution to this hence the idea was than devloped. This application will allow access to many people as most of today's generation doesn't know what the previous vesion was like. If the game becomes virtual most people will be able to have fun eith it on the palms of their hands and take part in this fun filled experience.</p>
